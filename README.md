# apme-api

Track sanitized client references, document workflows, destination jurisdictions, appointments, deadlines, and case events for a visa and apostille consulting firm.

## Safety and production boundary

This software is an operational starter and does not provide legal advice. Keep identity documents and sensitive case files out of logs and this bootstrap data model; production use requires encryption, access controls, retention rules, auditability, and jurisdiction-specific professional review.

This repository is an executable bootstrap, not a production deployment. Before live
use, add authentication, tenant authorization, rate limits, durable migrations,
observability, backups, incident response, dependency review, and secret management.
## Routes

- `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz`, `GET /metrics`
- `GET|POST /api/v1/cases`
- `GET /api/v1/cases/{id}`
- `GET /ws` for JSON event envelopes

The bootstrap uses bounded in-memory state so transport behavior is immediately
testable. Replace it with SeaORM/PostgreSQL transactions before production and keep
`apme-interfaces` as the tagged wire-contract authority.

```bash
cargo run
```

## Environment secrets

Secrets live in this repo **encrypted** with [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) + [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age):
`env/enc/<dev|prod>.env.enc` is committed; `just env-use <name>` decrypts it to
`env/dec/<name>.env` (gitignored, mode 0600) and symlinks `./.env` to it. The
Nix dev shell provides the tooling, `just env-audit` runs keyless in CI, and
containers decrypt at `docker run` — never at build. See [`env/README.md`](env/README.md).
